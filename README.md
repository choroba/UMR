# Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR) at ÚFAL

This repository serves the UMR group at [ÚFAL](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/) to
discuss, understand and elaborate the [UMR
guidelines](https://github.com/umr4nlp/umr-guidelines/blob/master/guidelines.md)
(see also [our fork here](https://github.com/ufal/umr-guidelines/blob/master/guidelines.md))
and to explore possibilities of conversions between
[PDT](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/prague-dependency-treebank),
[UD](https://universaldependencies.org/),
[PDT-Vallex](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt-vallex-valency-lexicon-linked-czech-corpora),
[SynSemClass](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/synsemclass) and UMR.

The research is conducted in the frame of the [GAČR project
LUSyD](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/grants/lusyd).
