# UMR meeting minutes


## Monday, Feb 24, 2025

(Dan, Federica, Hanka, Jan H., Markéta, Jan Š., Šárka, Minoo)

#### Expected outcomes (Jan H.)

**US UMR project (= infrastructure project):**
- multilingual DATA as main outcome (no research) --> **Czech UMR data** (see below);
- foster the cooperation;
- [6th DMR workshop](https://dmr2025.github.io/index), Prague,  August 4-5 2025.

**Czech [UMR-related projects](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/uniform-meaning-representation-czech):**
- publications (will be specified, including the required acknowledgement);
  - publications can be also on UMR for other languages than Czech, e.g., Latin or Persian (the project report will explain that it was important to gain a multi-lingual perspective)
- Czech data:
   - **goal: approx. 10,000 manually annotated sentences (~ 5% of PDT-C)**
     10 minutes per sentence (on average) ... **??? > 200 person-days ???**
     - start of (massive) manual annotation – end of 2025;
       - either selected phenomena OR all phenomena on a smaller sample;
     - some data for inter-annotator agreement;
     - annotation with SynSemClass in mid 2025 (SSC still under construction)
   - **automatic transfer**:
     - choice of phenomena and their granularity: up to us;
     - internal deadline for new version: mid June, 2025
     (2 internal data releases each year)


**Suitable evaluation data:**
- set of phenomena that should be covered (Honza: implemented)
- data for overall evaluation plus additional data for individual phenomena (and their combinations)?


#### TODO:
- for Dan, Hanka, Markéta:
   -  feedback on Czech UD conversion (Federica's email from Jan 21);
   -  UMR annotation task (Federica's email from Jan 23);
- for Markéta, Honza:
   - complete [the release notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0ou24nai8gPcJxIFbk1zMMYHgUCLSDD/edit);
   - prepare an overview what has been done (based on Honza's [slides](https://ufallab.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~stepanek/2501-umr/) and with his support), see above the release notes;
- for Honza:
   - conversion of Latin data
- ??? searchable PDT-C 2.0 in [PML-TQ](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/pmltq/) (Lindat)
