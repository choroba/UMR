# Entities

**Entities** constitute one of the three main types of concepts in UMR, alongside **states** and **processes.**
They typically correspond to physical objects, but there are also abstract entities such as _soul._

A _mention_ of an entity in text can be **specific** or **generic.**
A specific mention refers to a concrete, unique instance of the entity. Not necessarily by its name (meaning that
not every specific entity is a named entity), but there is one specific instance that the speaker has in mind.

In (1a), there are three mentions of the same specific entity, the unique institution in Prague, called “National Museum”.
It is first referred to by its name, then by the personal pronoun _mu_, and finally by the common noun _muzeum_.
In contrast, the common noun _muzea_ (plural of _muzeum_) in (1b) is a generic entity: It refers to various institutions
that all belong to the category of museums.

* (1a) [cs] _Národní muzeum v Praze získá nový bezpečnostní systém, který mu dodá firma CESS. Muzeum za něj zaplatí necelé 2 milióny korun._
            “The National Museum in Prague will get a new security system, which will be supplied by CESS. The museum will pay almost 2 million crowns for it.”
* (1b) [cs] _V každé zemi podléhají muzea jiné legislativě._
            “In each country, museums are subject to different legislation.”

If a proper name is used, it typically refers to a specific entity, but as we see in (1a), specific entities can be
referenced by other means, too. Even if the name were not present in the sentence, the context would tell us that
we are talking about one specific museum, which probably has a name, and perhaps the context would be specific enough
to allow us to identify the entity and its name in the real world. However, that is not a necessary condition for
a specific entity. In (2a), _staršího muže_ “an elderly man” refers to a person whom we do not know and who may not
even exist in the real world (the text may be a work of fiction). The man may not be mentioned again and we may not
learn anything else about him, yet in this local context he is a specific entity and not a generic one.

* (2) [cs] _Když opouštěl budovu, zahlédl staršího muže, jenž nesl v náručí žlutou krabici._
           “As he was leaving the building, he saw an elderly man carrying a yellow box in his arms.”

A specific entity is a **named entity** if it is referenced by its **name.** Name is a word or a sequence of words
whose purpose is to label a specific instance, not to describe a category of entities by their properties or relations
to other entities. Thus _muzeum_ is not a name because it can be used to refer to any institution that meets certain
parameters. The phrase _Národní muzeum_ is a name because it was specifically designed to label one particular museum.
The name does not have to be unique: An important museum in another country may also be called _Národní muzeum_, just
like there are multiple people called _John Smith_. People may have to add more information if misinterpretation is
possible, but the intended purpose of a name is to give the entity a reasonably locally unique identifier, and the
purpose is what matters.

Furthermore, it is not necessary that a specific entity has only one name. For example, _Spojené státy americké_,
_Spojené státy_, _USA_ and _Amerika_ are all names and all refer to the same country. One can even encounter just
_Státy_ used as a name and referring to the USA. When used in a Czech sentence in this manner, it cannot refer to,
e.g., the United States of Mexico. The same word, _státy_ “states” (not capitalized, unless sentence-initial), can
be used as a common noun (hence not a name), referring to a group of entities (states or countries) that may be
specific or generic. On the other hand, depending on context, _Amerika_ may refer to a continent rather than to
a country (North America, South America), or it may refer to a quarry southwest of Prague.

Proper names are thus designed to label specific instances, while common nouns are meant to describe broader
categories (types). The borderline may be occasionally blurry when a common noun is repurposed as a name (as we
have seen with _Státy_ above) but it is much less likely that a proper name will be used for a generic entity.
We can certainly define a category of all people named _Václav_, as in (3), but that does not convert the name
into a common noun – all these people first got that name with the hope that it will make them identifiable and
distinguishable from other people, and only later the speaker artificially grouped them, using their name as
the property defining the group.

* (3) [cs] _Všichni Václavové by měli znát své slavné jmenovce._
           “All Václavs should know their famous namesakes.”
