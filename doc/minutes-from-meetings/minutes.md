- **Conversion:** 
   - Markéta, Hanka: continue with _být_ and _mít_ frames, newly [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ocs1-IG5JUebKFT0NjlO28WgxM6NANMc/edit?gid=171036479#gid=171036479); 
   - ~~check AMR to UMR automatic conversion [here](https://aclanthology.org/2023.tlt-1.8/)!~~
- **Automatic conversion** - further possible steps: 
   - nodes for #Gen, #Unsp, [issue #23](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/issues/23)
   - personal pronouns with 1st and 2nd person should be converted as `person` (rather than `entity`), [issue #24](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/issues/24)
   - `polite` attribute (todo)

## Monday, June 16, 2025

(Dan, Federica, Hanka, Jan Š., Markéta)

#### Updates:
- Federica: short report on the [UMR Summer School](https://umr4nlp.github.io/web/SummerSchool2025.html).
- Federica: [UMR Schema](https://umr4nlp.github.io/web/UMRSchemaPages/index.html) - lists and lattices with definitions and examples. It contains lists for:
    - Participant roles, non-participant roles, and attribute roles
    - The `:aspect` attribute
    - Modal attribute roles
    - Abstract concepts
    - Named Entity hierarchy
    - Nonprototypical Predication -91 rolesets
    - Discourse Relations
    - Abstract -91 rolesets
- Federica: [UMR Writer 3.0](https://umr-tool.cs.brandeis.edu/) works much better than 2.0.
    The tool supports the format described in the UMR Release 2.0 (see the README.md file). It can compare two files, compute the AnCast F1 score, and present their differences in a GitHub-style view.

- Markéta: [UMR 2.0 - Czech: Release Notes](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/blob/main/papers/2025-data-release-notes-2-0.md) as  [ÚFAL TR-2025-74](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/techrep/tr74.pdf).   
**The markup version should be fixed** - internal links do not work!
  - most frequent _být_ frames prepared for conversion ... see the [pdt_pb table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVo7a8hPBReI4VrgNkUGem8uC_sCQCXJJvLFCbwPuok/edit?gid=1270330829#gid=1270330829)

- Honza: `refer-number`, `refer-person` conversion finalized (for the time being)
- Honza:  personal and some demonstrative pronouns converted as `event` (rather than `entity`) if they refer to verbs 
   -  personal pronouns with 1st and 2nd person should be converted as `person` (rather than `entity`) ??

   - Markéta, Hanka: continue with _být_ and _mít_ frames; 
   - check AMR to UMR automatic conversion [here](https://aclanthology.org/2023.tlt-1.8/)! 
- **Automatic conversion** - further possible steps: 
   - `FPHR` without #Forn.ID as its head, [issue 22](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/issues/22)  
   - nodes for #Gen, #Unsp, [issue 23](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/issues/23)
   - `polite` attribute (todo)
   - `mode` attribute (todo)
   -  _být_ frames

     FAUST ... APP 2x  
     PCEDT ... APP 0x  
     PDTSC ... APP 46x  
     PDT ... APP 30034x 
   - based on the PDT 2.0 manual: 
     -  (2) _příslušník armády_.APP: příslušnosti osoby k nějakému celku, instituci (člen/part je rodičem -- instituce/celek je dítětem) ... OK, UMR: possessor or whole as the daughter
     - (3) _tým brankářů_.APP: příslušnosti osoby k nějakému celku, instituci **instituce/celek je rodičem -- člen/part je dítětem) ... BUT UMR: possessor/whole as the daughter**

## Monday, May 19, 2025

(Dan, Federica, Hanka, Jan Š., Markéta)

#### Updates:
- [UMR 2.0](http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-5902) finally out
- Honza: conversion of the `refer-number` attribute almost final (ML will check the converted data), some improvements in the `refer-person` attribute (not final yet)
- Honza: fixed search in TrEd
- Hana: what to do with action nouns, agent nouns in [noun-to-verbs conversion](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/tree/main/tecto2umr/derivace-podklady), see [the description](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/blob/main/tecto2umr/derivace-podklady/description.txt)
- summary: conversion nouns that denote events (e.g., koncert from koncertovat, běh from běhat) identified based on annotation from previous project with Magda 
- manually annotated them for whether it is possible to assign them to a single verbs frame (that they would likely have in all occurrences) [annotation_file_conversion](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/blob/main/tecto2umr/derivace-podklady/conversion_action_nouns_annotation.tsv)
- 137 converted nouns were mapped to a single PDT-Vallex frame 
- out of them, those which are available in PDT-Vallex are also annotated for how the form of their valency slots (e.g., case, preposition) maps to PropBank-style arguments (with some, the mapping is unfortunately ambiguous, especially with the genitive form between ARG0 and ARG1)
- final file for conversion with all the mapping that was possible so far:[final_mapping_file_conversion]( https://github.com/ufal/UMR/blob/main/tecto2umr/derivace-podklady/conversion_action_nouns_final.tsv)

#### TODO:
- **[Release notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0ou24nai8gPcJxIFbk1zMMYHgUCLSDD/edit)** ... postponed  
 (Appendix: still missing examples); then publish as a technical report 
- Markéta, Hanka: conversion of _být_, _mít_ frames 
- Markéta: polite, mode attribute  (as Github issues)?
- Hanka: noun-to-verb conversion - next steps for Honza (as Github issues)?
- **Possibility to annotate/re-arrange UMRs in TrEd?** ...   postponed  
 (This would significantly speed up the annotation!)


#### NEXT meetings

## Monday, May 12, 2025

(Dan, Hanka, Jan Š., Markéta)
- Hanka: indentifying nouns denoting events - progress:
- conversion nouns that denote events (e.g., koncert from koncertovat, běh from běhat) and agent nouns identified based on annotation from previous project with Magda [conversion_source_file](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/blob/main/tecto2umr/derivace-podklady/summarisation.xlsx),  [agent_nouns_source_file](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/blob/main/tecto2umr/derivace-podklady/agent-nouns_GOLD.tsv), 
- for conversion nouns, we tok all that were annotated in all 50 occurrences as "action", for agent nouns, we took those that were never found to be inanimate (and therefore shouldn't be ambiguous between an agentive and intrumental reading)
- conversion nouns often have both perfective and imperfective verb available + the verbs often have multiple frames available (only 65 have a single verbal counterpart that has a single valency frame) -> for next time, try whether they could be mapped manually to a single verb frame that would likely apply to all the noun¨s occurrences 
- for agent nouns, there are 401 that map to a verb with a single valency frame and 384 that map onto a verb with multiple frames [agent_nouns_single_frame_file](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/blob/main/tecto2umr/derivace-podklady/agent_nouns_single_frame.tsv),  [agent_nouns_multiple_frames_file](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/blob/main/tecto2umr/derivace-podklady/agent_nouns_multiple_frames.tsv)
- I also searched NomVallex for nouns that only have one frame and that frame has the semantic category "action" - 91 such nouns, all of the -ní/-tí variety [NomVallex_action_nouns_single_frame_file](https://github.com/ufal/UMR/blob/main/tecto2umr/derivace-podklady/nomvallex_lexemes_single_frame_action.tsv)

## Monday, May 5, 2025

(Dan, Federica, Hanka, Jan Š., Markéta)

#### Updates:
- Honza:
   - conversion of the attributes `refer-number` and `refer-person` improved (not final yet)
   - inner participants --> arguments conversion, [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVo7a8hPBReI4VrgNkUGem8uC_sCQCXJJvLFCbwPuok/edit?gid=1270330829#gid=1270330829)
      - column E newly considered;
      - problems with frames with alternations - if there are more children nodes with relevant functor(s), which of the should be considered argument?
      - the same problem may arise with more obligatory free modifications (LOC, MANN, ...) that are considered arguments in UMR;
      - the same problem may arise with reifications.
   - discourse relations `but-91`, `contrast-91`, `identity-91`, `have-cause-91` should have just 2 arguments (labeled `ARG1`, `ARG2`) 
- Hanka: plans to investigate the possibility to identify eventive nouns and mapped to respective verb frames (NomVallex, Magda's and Hanka's tables)
- Markéta: 
   - plans to work on _být_ frames and suggest conversion rules
   - conversion rules for the attributes `polite`and `mode`  



#### TODO:
- **[Release notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0ou24nai8gPcJxIFbk1zMMYHgUCLSDD/edit)** ... postponed  
 (Appendix: still missing examples); then publish as a technical report 
- **Possibility to annotate/re-arrange UMRs in TrEd?** ...   postponed  
 (This would significantly speed up the annotation!)

   - completed 25 sentences from PDT (2 documents; 5 s. from each document  with parallel annotation)
   - completed 50 senteces from PDTSC (2 documents, 1/2 of each; 5 s. from each document  with parallel annotation)
   - to be completed: ??10 sentences from PCEDT (from 2 documents) 
- Federica: manual annotation for Latin data, should be also included in the paper  


#### TODO:
- **DMR workshop** ... plan to finish the paper before Easter

- publications (will be specified, including the required acknowledgement);
  - publications can be also on UMR for other languages than Czech, e.g., Latin or Persian (the project report will explain that it was important to gain a multi-lingual perspective)
  - Publication committment:
  - 1st period (until Dec. 2024): 3 conference papers (done),

      - Czech data:
   - **goal: approx. 10,000 manually annotated sentences (~ 5% of PDT-C)**
     10 minutes per sentence (on average) ... **??? > 200 person-days ???**
     - start of (massive) manual annotation – end of 2025;
       - either selected phenomena OR all phenomena on a smaller sample;
     - some data for inter-annotator agreement;
     - annotation with SynSemClass in mid 2025 (SSC still under construction)
   - **automatic transfer**:
     - choice of phenomena and their granularity: up to us;
     - internal deadline for new version: mid June, 2025
     (2 internal data releases each year)


**Suitable evaluation data:**
- set of phenomena that should be covered (Honza: implemented)
- data for overall evaluation plus additional data for individual phenomena (and their combinations)?


#### TODO:
- for Dan, Hanka, Markéta:
   -  feedback on Czech UD conversion (Federica's email from Jan 21);
   -  UMR annotation task (Federica's email from Jan 23);
- for Markéta, Honza:
   - complete [the release notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0ou24nai8gPcJxIFbk1zMMYHgUCLSDD/edit);
