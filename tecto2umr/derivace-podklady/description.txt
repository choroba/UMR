list-of-paradigms.tsv = file with conversion pairs
agent-nouns_GOLD.tsv = file with agent nouns
conversion_action_nouns_annotation.tsv = file with annotation of conversion pairs for matching valency frame of a corresponding verb
conversion_action_nouns_final.tsv = file with action noun + corresponding verb's frame + if available in PDT-Vallex, mapping of forms onto PropBank-style arguments

1) AGENT NOUNS
- I searched the "agent-nouns_GOLD.tsv" file for agent noun + verb pairs
- possible for a single verb to have multiple agent nouns
- these agent nouns are marked as always being animate, i.e. those that can also be inanimate and have a different (usually instrumental) meaning are not considered (e.g., "ukazatel")
- files:
	- agent_nouns_single_frame.tsv = list of agent nouns + their base verbs that only have 1 valency frame in PDT-Vallex + the valency frame identifiers (401 verbs)

	- agent_nouns_multiple_frames.tsv = list of agent nouns + their base verbs that have multiple valency frame in PDT-Vallex  + the valency frames identifiers (384 verbs) + the chosen valency frame that corresponds to the agent noun in (very likely) all occurrences, if possible (235 such nouns)
	
2) ACTION NOUNS IN NOMVALLEX
- I searched NomVallex for nouns that only have one lexical unit (one entry, one valency frame) in NomVallex and that lexical unit is marked as semantic category = "action"
- 91 such nouns, all of them of the -ní/-tí variety
- file:
	- nomvallex_lexemes_single_frame_action.tsv = action noun + the verb's lexical unit identifier (I am not sure what exactly the identifier used in NomVallex is, i.e. how to link it to a PDT-Vallex identifier, for now I just copied the identifier as it is in NomVallex)

3) ACTION NOUNS FROM CONVERSION PAIRS ("SUFIXLESS" ACTION NOUNS)
- I searched the "list-of-paradigms.tsv" file for converted action noun + verb pairs (e.g., "koncert - koncertovat", "práce - "pracovat"; they are sufixless nouns that have a verbal counterpart)
- only selected those nouns that have been marked with semantic label "action" in all of the 50 corpus occurrences that were examined
- problematic: there is often not a single verb, but an aspectual pair that correspond to the noun (e.g., "výroba - vyrábět/vyrobit"), sometimes even multiple imperfective or perfective verbs (e.g., "přenos - přenést/přenosit / přenášet")
- I note down both the perfective and imperfective verb(s) separately
- file: 
	- conversion_action_nouns.tsv = includes the following columns:
		- action_noun
		- imperfective_verb
		- pdt_valency_frame_ipf = valency frame(s) of the imperfective verb(s) in PDT-Vallex
		- number_frames_ipf = number of frames that the imperfective verb has in PDT-Vallex (if there are multiple imperfective verbs, it is not counted)
		- perfective_verb
		- pdt_valency_frame_pf = valency frame(s) of the perfective verb(s) in PDT-Vallex
		- number_frames_pf = number of frames that the perfective verb has in PDT-Vallex (if there are multiple imperfective verbs, it is not counted)
	- there are 50 nouns that only have an imperfective verb and that verb has a single valency frame
	- there are 15 nouns that only have a perfective verb and that verb has a single valency frame
	- there are 23 nouns that have both an imperfective verb and a perfective verb and both have a single valency frame	
- "conversion_action_nouns_annotation.tsv" = I manually annotated each of the conversion nouns that have only been marked with the "action" semantic label for whether it is possible to say that in all occurrences, they will likely correspond to a 1) single verb, 2) if yes, a single valency frame of that verb -> 137 such nouns where it is possible to identify a single valency frame of a corresponding verb
- "conversion_action_nouns_final.tsv" - for those 137 nouns, the second columns provides the corresponding verb's valency frame and if the noun was also found in PDT-Vallex, the following columns provide the mapping of forms (i.e., case, preposition etc.) onto PropBank-like arguments based on the PDT-Vallex entries
