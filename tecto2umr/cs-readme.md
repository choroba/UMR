# Acknowledgments

The creators of the Czech UMRs wish to express their gratitude to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX <!-- to the following individuals who have been instrumental in its development: -->

The Czech UMRs are automatically converted from the Prague Dependency Treebank – Consolidated ([PDT-C](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt-c)), version 1.9. (December 20, 2024).

The conversion covers selected phenomena pertaining to the sentence level annotation (esp. structure of the graph, nodes labeling, PropBank-like argument structure for verbs, refer attributes). Further, coreference relations are identified, both intra- and inter-sentential. More detailed release notes are on [the project webpage](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/uniform-meaning-representation-czech).
