DZ annotations over the output of juːmæʧ comparison.
I only annotate lines which report that a node from one side was left unmapped to the other side.
Prefixing the line with "DZGOOD	" means that I agree that the node should be left unmapped.
Prefixing the line with "DZBAD	" means that I believe it should have been mapped to other DZBAD node.
That is I ignore the possibility that it should have been mapped to a node which itself is not unmapped. Such situation would probably indicate issues in the word alignment indicated in the file.
I also do not assess correctness of the mapping for mapped nodes. And on a related note, we cannot guarantee that if we decided to map some of the unmapped nodes, we would succeed in doing it correctly.
Note that I spotted quite a few wrong alignments in the first few sentences of the gold file!
And once I saw name["Leyta"] (taken from :opN of name) but it is a typo, it should be "Leyte".

So far done until sentence 28 (line 6340), i.e., the entire first document. Sentence 29 starts a new document.

Before symmetrization, 34 gold nodes were projected ambiguously to 73 conv nodes.
Before symmetrization, 66 conv nodes were projected ambiguously to 133 gold nodes.
Concept and relation comparison (only mapped nodes; unmapped are ignored):
Out of 3364 non-empty gold values, 1045 found in conv => recall    31.06%.
Out of 3506 non-empty conv values, 1045 found in gold => precision 29.81%.
 => F₁ = 30.42%.
Concept and relation comparison (for unmapped nodes all counted as incorrect):
Out of 4563 non-empty gold values, 1045 found in conv => recall    22.90%.
Out of 4418 non-empty conv values, 1045 found in gold => precision 23.65%.
 => juːmæʧ (gold, conv) = F₁ = 23.27%.
