SUMMARY:
Number of tokens: 374
Number of nodes per file: GOLD:442, CONV:305
File-to-file node mapping:
Out of 442 total GOLD nodes, 235 mapped to CONV => recall    = 53%.
Out of 305 total CONV nodes, 235 mapped to GOLD => precision = 77%.
 => F₁(GOLD,CONV) = 63%.
Before symmetrization, 23 GOLD nodes were projected ambiguously to 48 CONV nodes.
Before symmetrization, 6 CONV nodes were projected ambiguously to 12 GOLD nodes.
Concept and relation comparison (only mapped nodes; unmapped are ignored):
Out of 622 non-empty GOLD values, 352 found in CONV => recall    57%.
Out of 633 non-empty CONV values, 352 found in GOLD => precision 56%.
 => F₁ = 56%.
Concept and relation comparison (for unmapped nodes all counted as incorrect):
Out of 1318 non-empty GOLD values, 352 found in CONV => recall    27%.
Out of 770 non-empty CONV values, 352 found in GOLD => precision 46%.
 => juːmæʧ (GOLD, CONV) = F₁ = 34%.
